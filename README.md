# The Game Library

The Game Library is a React web application, utilising the IGDB API to display the games readily available from the API. In this app, the user is able to view games in table form as well as in a more detailed view, containing more information about a game. Users can also search for their games via the search bar and apply filters (Name, Platforms and Genres). The app also contains a random game generator. Clicking on the link will bring the user to a random game's page.

## Setup

- If running through Localhost, clone the project, install all dependencies and run the command "npm run dev" within the root directory.
- If running through Firebase, the link of the website is provided here: "https://the-game-library.firebaseapp.com"
